Running OpenAssistant
---------------------
* The latest documentation can be found on our wiki at http://openassistant.org/wiki/

* Install dependencies and tools. Please see http://openassistant.org/wiki/doku.php?id=installation

* Download and unpack the latest ``openassistant-master.zip`` package.

* Edit ``run.sh`` to configure desired variables, then save.

* Make ``run.sh`` executable with: ``$chmod +x ./run.sh``

* Run ``./run.sh -c -H20 -m0 -M mind/boot``. Global variables will be set and ``run.py`` will launch.

* If ``$MINDDIR/conf/commands.json`` has changed and your machine is online, a new dictionary and language model will be created via the `Sphinx Knowledge Base Tool <http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/tools/lmtool.html>`__.

* Say `Launch Open Assistant` to enable operating system control commands such as `Maximize Window` and `Fullscreen`. Say `Launch Stella` to initiate a dialogue with her mind. To have Stella quit say `Goodbye Stella`. Say `Close Open Assistant` to quit operating system command recognition.

* To change assistant commands and language, edit ``conf/commands.json``. Exit and relaunch ``run.sh``.

* For usage instructions, check out the `Open Assistant Wiki <http://openassistant.org/wiki/doku.php?id=usage>`_.

* For help, you can receive support in the `Open Assistant Forum <http://openassistant.org/community/>`_.


Next Steps
